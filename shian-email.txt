Hi Shian, 

I hope this finds you well!

Esperanza (in CC) and I are planning to run a conference for PGT at the beginning of October (around 40 people for two days, over the weekend). We used a template you send us for another initiative to put together the funding application. 

This is the first time we are organising a conference and we have some questions:
1. We are thinking of using some spaces at the University to host our conference (talks, workshops and social activities). We were thinking about Prestonfield Room (Pollock Halls) for talks, workshops and poster sessions and New Amphion (Teviot) for the social activities. Would we also need to apply for funding for using this room or will it be covered by the department? Do you think the room in Pollock Halls is equipped for conferences?
2. We are planning to organise two poster sessions. Would the price of poster printing be covered by the funding or will be managed internally? 
3. We have the same question but for catering (2), provided by Edinburgh First. We estimated the prices in the funding application but we are happy to change them/remove or add lines to the file. Moreover, we took https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/ssif-event-planning-guide.pdf as a reference but we noticed that it is dated back to 2018. Are the guidelines and prices still reliable today?
4. Can purchase food which is not covered by the Edinburgh First catering? re: social activity in the application.
5. In case we would need to change some details (e.g. increases or decreases in the number of participants, increases in prices - compared to the ones of 2018, changes of rooms to book) can we apply for more funding under Esperanza's name or would it be better to apply for changes?

Thanks in advance for your help and apologies for all the questions.

All the best, 
Esperanza and Greta
